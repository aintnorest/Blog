# Famo.us  


I started using Famo.us for production applications around May 2014. I built 2 applications and had 2 more in progress before deciding to move away from Famo.us. Originally I brought Famo.us to my employeer’s attention right as it was coming out of private beta. Based on a small amount of reading and code diving, I told my boss something to the effect of, “It is an interesting approaching that looks like it could be amazing. We should really keep an eye on it and give it a try once it’s more stable.” Two weeks later I was told we had a new project and they were sold on using Famo.us. The first draft of this post was written in Nov of 2014 and at that time I went on to focus on a cluster of what I felt were common problems and how I went about fixing them. As I am now not using Famo.us as my primary view layer, I thought it might be better to focus on why.


There were two major factors that convinced me it was time to move on. The first was community. Famo.us had a few employees and non company affiliated users that were great at answering questions and helping to get new users up to speed. On the down side, once you reached a deeper understanding of how the framework worked, there were very few people that could help you. The framework had a lot of hype, but not enough good engineers working with it in production to support users. I do want to say there were and are some amazing people still working with it, but currently there isn’t enough production usage to iron out the kinks.


The other factor was in part caused by my company’s early adoption. Famo.us released from private beta with some fundemental problems in its rendering engine. While they continued to put smaller fixes and a few newer features out,  they didn’t fix the underlying problems. The reasoning behind this, as far as I could tell, was because they were putting a lion share of their effort behind putting out a new engine that was re-engineered for what they called mixed-mode. This put anyone trying to use their framework in production in a difficult spot because any in-depth applications started to show the strain.


Since I’ve moved on, Famo.us has released their new mixed-mode version and although I’m very pleased with React I do have every intent to keep an eye on Famo.us going into the future. In a future post I’ll talk about React, it’s tremendous successes, it’s weak points, and what convinced me to switch.
