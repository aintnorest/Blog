# Staying Current

In a field that is constantly changing and growing it can seem impossible. Especially if you are hoping to have a balanced work/life. I thought I would go over a few of the ways I stay up on new technologies / libraries.


- Newsletters are a great way to stay connected. The sheer number of them may seem overwhelming but between the scattered drop rate, article overlap, and my interest in articles, I end up only reading a few articles a day.
	- [npm weekly](https://www.npmjs.com/npm-weekly)
	- [html5 weekly](http://html5weekly.com/)
    - [css weekly](http://css-weekly.com/)
	- [ng-newsletter](http://www.ng-newsletter.com/)
	- [reactjs newsletter](http://reactjsnewsletter.com/)
	- [web tools weekly](http://webtoolsweekly.com/)
	- [hacker newsletter](http://www.hackernewsletter.com/)
	- [responsive design weekly](http://responsivedesignweekly.com/)
	- [web design weekly](https://web-design-weekly.com/)
	- [javascript weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)

- Podcasts are my way to fill otherwise empty brain time. My commute and daily chores around the house are good examples. There are probably more than twice this number out there but as I have bad hearing and I’m usually listening when there is a lot of background noise I tend to only listen to podcasts with good sound quality and no strong accents.

- Twitter was probably the biggest surprise for me. My initial impression of Twitter was a place where people talked about random snippets of their life. My second impression was when a coworker told me it could be a great resource for trends and news if you followed the right people; He then took my phone to “add the right people” long story short he subscribed me to a large number of porn accounts. That behind me months later when I gave it another shot, I found out he was right. I try to keep it focused to things that interest me.

It can still be hard to find the time especially for the articles. I find it really helpful to open any articles that seem interesting into a new window and just keep skimming titles / summaries and then coming back to actually read the articles when I have a few moments to sit and relax.
